Hi!

I am sharedassumptions. I am starting this blog, a blog which I hope will become a community effort. This blog aims to provide unbiased political analysis based on rigid adherence to the methodology of reason, while still having fun.

A bit more about me. I am an American. I am white. I don't identify as any gender. I don't identify as belonging to any political party. I belong to no political organization. I have no financial incentive in this work. I have no agendas to push other than the agenda of publishing political analysis based on rigid adherence to the methodology of reason, and the agenda of having fun. I am choosing not to provide many specific details about myself, because I want the focus in analyzing my posts to be on the content and not on me.

For those reading who know me, please don't disclose publicly that I am sharedassumptions, and please don't tell others that I am sharedassumptions. I would like to be the one to share that information. Thank you.

# More about me

I studied computer programming and electronic music production on my own time in high school; these were my first major experiences with higher cognition.

I became a more philosophical person after my first LSD experience. I became interested in Eastern mysticism and Western occultism, and I practiced meditation, Yoga, and occult rituals. I experimented with a wide variety of hallucinogens.

I studied a variety of major and obscure philosophical schools, including (in no particular order) existentialism, analytic philosophy, classical Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy, [Crowleyan occultism](http://hermetic.com/crowley/), the American drug-fueled academic mysticism of the 60s and 70s (a la Robert Anton Wilson's *Cosmic Trigger* and Timothy Leary's *Exo-Psychology*), and the academic extraterrestrial mysticism of [L/L Research](http://www.llresearch.org/), esp. the [Law of One](http://www.lawofone.info/). I suppose I was searching for the fundamental meaning of life.

The influence of my college professors and some of my smart friends led me to realize the problematic nature of the methods I was using to select my beliefs. The biggest early influence on me in this regard came from the [LessWrong rationality materials](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_materials).

My philosophy became more analytical in this period, and I thought deeply to try to understand fundamental issues in epistemology, especially in their relationship with mysticism and spirituality. I was a deeply spiritual person at this time, so these were very live concerns for me.

My philosophical questions led me progressively deeper into higher math, especially the areas of mathematical logic and set theory. I studied math in classes, and went to graduate school to study philosophy, where I specialized in logic. I did original research at the intersection of math and philosophy, which I published in prestigious journals. Then I dropped out of school to pursue a career as a software developer. That's how I pay the bills today.

In philosophy school I spent hundreds of hours studying the going rigorous academic theories of reasoning, including fields like formal logic, the foundations of mathematics, probability theory, and statistics. I gained a broad general education in higher math. I spent hundreds of hours grappling with some of humanity's fuzziest, most intractable questions with my colleagues, ranging across all fields of philosophy.

In comparison, the work I do as a software developer is simpler. It's very detail-oriented work which requires reasoning under imperfect information about inconceivably complex and chronically surprising objects (computers), and which has to be done perfectly for my company's high-profile clients. This is a tough grind, but I feel it's helped me to become less biased and more patient in my thinking.

I felt in retrospect that bias was rampant in the work done in the philosophy department I was in (including my work). It seemed that by the professional standards of analytic philosophy, it was OK to be biased, as long as you used arguments that were hard to refute. This is probably right as a professional standard, and it still allows for academic progress to flourish, but I do think it damages the profession in subtle ways that so many people accept the license to be biased.

In my work environment, I feel I need to reason in an unbiased way to avoid being eaten. There's a need to form judgments based on incomplete information about complex systems, and we need to actually get it right or there are consequences for the large corporations we serve and potentially for thousands of everyday people. Achieving the level of correctness our problems demand requires employing elementary methods from logic and science, and most of all it requires the willingness to patiently grind through lots of little facts, and to consistently maintain a skeptical attitude where we are open to all hypotheses consistent with the observable facts. I feel that this environment has grown my capacity for neutrality.

Like everybody, my political awareness has grown over the course of my life. I am an American. I was raised in a liberal environment. My parents are Unitarian Universalists. I haven't been naturally exposed to a significant amount of conservative thought in the course of my everyday life. 

The election of Trump was a wake-up call for me. It made me realize I didn't understand what was going on politically in my country. I also felt there was a general vacuum of neutral understanding of the present American political situation. I felt called to help with that problem.

I am still developing my conception of political rationality. Politics is of course the hardest topic of all to reason neutrally about. I'm bringing everything I've learned to bear on the problem, and seeking role models for neutral political reasoning.

This blog series is not primarily about my conception of political rationality. It's about my conception of rationality in general. However, analyzing generalities without getting into specifics is a crime against rationality, so political rationality is one of the areas I wish to discuss.

# Blog rules

The rest of this post is essentially a constitution for this blog. It describes the blog's duties to the reader, and the rules contributors agree to follow in order to realize them.

Contributors agree to make their best effort to realize the aims of the blog as set out in the first paragraph of this post.

Contributors will strive to be inoffensive to all groups. E.g., contributors will strive not to offend the members of any race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religious affiliation, political organization, or political philosophy. Contributors will strive not to offend any group, however unpopular.

When people are offended by the mere presentation of a cogent argument presented in a neutral tone, the priority of presenting the argument in general supersedes the priority of not offending anybody. Posts should be written in a way which minimizes the chances of unnecessary offense caused by misunderstanding, but it's also not necessary to hand-hold the reader. Balancing these different considerations is a delicate matter to which we should devote considerable thought.

All contributors will abide by a standard of anonymity. Contributors will be identified by anonymous handles and inspecific details about who they are. "Inspecific details" are any details which don't narrow down the number of people they could be to a relatively small number. We can stay anonymous and keep the focus on the ideas by herding together under this philosophy. If this breaks down eventually and our identities are made public, that's acceptable from my point of view.

The whole world is an editor of this blog. We will carry out our writing process on https://github.com/political-analysis/ (until such time as that needs to change). Anybody with a GitHub account can watch our editing process, and they can contribute by submitting issues and pull requests. Anybody who contributes to one of the repositories (e.g. by submitting issues or pull requests, or commenting on issues) is considered a contributor.

I am the managing editor of this blog. I have the final say on what gets published. This can change in the event it needs to change.

Anybody can submit articles for publication on this blog. For the time being, I will review all of these requests. Here's what you need to know to submit an article for publication.

Just email the article as a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) file to political-analysis@googlegroups.com. If I agree to start the editing process on your article, there are some additional steps to do.

To participate in the editing process, you'll need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, so sign up for one and learn how to use GitHub and Git if you haven't done that. GitHub has good resources on doing this. Remember to make your GitHub account anonymous; use a username that doesn't reveal your identity, and don't reveal your identity on your GitHub profile (including through your email address).

The easiest way to get an anonymous email address, if you have a Google email account, is to to create a [Google group](https://groups.google.com) and select "Collaborative inbox" as the group type. Don't invite anybody else to this group; the GitHub terms of service require your GitHub account to be used by a single individual or legal entity, and you probably need the same restriction on the email associated with it since for example it can be used for resetting your password.

Submit your article for publication by putting it into a GitHub repository as a Markdown file. *From your anonymous email address,* send a link to the repository to political-analysis@googlegroups.com. If you'd like to be in the loop about editing activity for the blog and other activity of the political-analysis GitHub organization, [join the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/political-analysis). No activity on this list yet, so as of this writing it's very low traffic!

If I think an article submission is a good candidate for putting into the revision process with the likely expectation of eventual publication, I will have you agree to license the material under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). I will fork it into the political-analysis organization. We will edit it. Then, whenever I feel it's time, I will publish it on this blog, assuming it reaches a state I find satisfactory.

Posts won't be edited or deleted after they are published on this blog. They are carved in stone once published on this blog. However, we may publish new editions of posts from time to time; e.g. an important post might get a new edition after a couple years, based on edits that happened in the interim.

This post is an exception to the general rule that posts won't be edited. This post will be edited in an append-only way to amend the blog constitution. Such amendments will also be announced on the Google group.

Amendments to the blog constitution will be developed on the Google group and GitHub via the open source method. I will have the final say on whether such amendments are implemented. This can change if it needs to.
