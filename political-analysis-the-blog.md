Hi!

I am sharedassumptions. I am starting this blog, a blog which I hope will become a community effort. This blog aims to provide unbiased political analysis based on rigid adherence to the methodology of reason, while still having fun.

A bit more about me. I am an American. I am white. I don't identify as any gender. I don't identify as belonging to any political party. I belong to no political organization. I have no financial incentive in this work. I consider myself personally secure in most likely political futures. I have no agendas to push other than the agenda of publishing political analysis based on rigid adherence to the methodology of reason, and the agenda of having fun. I am choosing not to provide many specific details about myself, because I want the focus in analyzing my posts to be on the content and not on me.

For those reading who know me, please don't disclose publicly that I am sharedassumptions, and please don't tell others that I am sharedassumptions. I would like to be the one to share that information. Thank you.

The rest of this post is essentially a constitution for this blog. It describes the blog's duties to the reader, and the rules contributors agree to follow in order to realize them.

Contributors agree to make their best effort to realize the aims of the blog as set out in the first paragraph of this post.

All contributors will abide by a standard of anonymity in accordance with the precedent I have set. Contributors will be identified by anonymous handles and inspecific details about who they are. We can stay anonymous and keep the focus on the ideas by herding together under this philosophy. If this breaks down eventually and our identities are made public, that's fine from my point of view.

The whole world is an editor of this blog. We will carry out our writing process on https://github.com/political-analysis/ (until such time as that needs to change). Anybody with a GitHub account can watch our editing process, and they can contribute by submitting issues and pull requests. Anybody who contributes to one of the repositories (e.g. by submitting issues or pull requests, or commenting on issues) is considered a contributor.

I am the managing editor of this blog. I have the final say on what gets published. This can change in the event it needs to change.

Anybody can submit articles for publication on this blog. For the time being, I will review all of these requests.

To participate in the editing process, you'll need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, so sign up for one and learn how to use GitHub and Git if you haven't done that. GitHub has good resources on doing this. Remember to make your GitHub account anonymous; use a username that doesn't reveal your identity, and don't reveal your identity on your GitHub profile (including through your email address).

The easiest way to get an anonymous email address, if you have a Google email account, is to to create a [Google group](https://groups.google.com) and select "Collaborative inbox" as the group type. Don't invite anybody else to this group; the GitHub terms of service require your GitHub account to be used by a single individual or legal entity, and you probably need the same restriction on the email associated with it since for example it can be used for resetting your password.

Submit your article for publication by putting it into a GitHub repository as a Markdown file. *From your anonymous email address,* send a link to the repository to political-analysis@googlegroups.com. If you'd like to be in the loop about editing activity for the blog and other activity of the political-analysis GitHub organization, [join the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/political-analysis). No activity on this list yet, so as of this writing it's very low traffic!

If I think an article submission is a good candidate for publication on the blog, given some revisions, I will have you agree to license the material under the [Apache License version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). I will fork it into the political-analysis organization. We will edit it. Then, whenever I feel it's time, I will publish it on this blog, assuming it reaches a state I find satisfactory.

Posts won't be edited or deleted after they are published on this blog. They are carved in stone once published on this blog.
